# Cold Notes

A simple markdown to HTML conversion of my notes. Ideally this should be expanded to allow for search and some other neat functionality.

## Setup

- Clone a set of notes into the /notes dir.

`npm i; npm run compile` to compile a set of notes in the notes dir.

- Alternatively you can copy `config-ex.json` to `config.json` with your own repo to streamline the deployment of new notes.
